<h1 align="center">JSON Server + House Keeping<br>(Back-End API REST Server for The Mojo Blog)</h1>
<br>


## Description
<p>Updated version of JSON Server (https://github.com/rbhachu/JSON-Server-Heroku) with House Keeping feature added to ensure db.json file is reset daily using Heroku Scheduler Plugin.
</p><br>


## Dependencies/NPM Modules
[JSON Server v0.16.3 *](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) - Creates a JSON REST API Server<br>
[Nodemon v2.0.7 *](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - Automatically restarts node application when file changes detected<br>
<i> * Installed automatically</i>
<br>
<br>


## Usage
<p>Once the app is installed (see `Installation` section below), you can reset the db.json file in './data/' root folder by executing the following command in the terminal.</p>

```sh
node ./bin/cleanup.js
```

<p>
This will run the cleanup.js file located in the './bin/' folder in the root of the site.

![Run Command](./imgs-readme/terminal1.png)

The cleanup.js file simply runs a function to overwrite the db.json file in the data folder with the original source values set in the db-source.json file.

*db-source.json file*
![File source](./imgs-readme/db-file.png)

The script (cleanup.js) can then be called potentially in your hosting platform via a scheduled task using the same command method as stated above.</p>

<br>
<p><i>
<b>NOTE:</b> After testing the script in Heroku, although the script executes successfully, the db.json does not update to the original values set in the db-source.json file.
<br><br>
However, I do have another tested and working solution I have managed to establish after many hours of research, link below.

```

<p>Also check for any updates by running the following command too.<p>

## Deployment
<p>Finally, to run the JSON server simply execute the following command in your terminal (ensuring you are in the correct project directory too).</p>

```sh

```

<p>After a few seconds, your browser should automatically open to the following link; 

[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and display the following `Success` message in the browser page too.</p>
